This is a timed trivia game in which the user answers one question at a time and receives feedback on each
question immediately after answering. If the user fails to answer the question within the alotted 30 seconds, 
the question times out and moves on to the next one.

I used Javascript and jQuery to code the game logic and user interactivity, and designed the look and feel of
the game using custom CSS.

I also created 5 abstract images, each pertaining to a particular question, using Cinema 4D and Adobe After Effects, 
to give the game periodic pops of color - especially because color is the theme of the game!
